Hi Brian and Kalpesh,

Thank you for the Technical Directive and the clarifications on the rig constraints.

I have reviewed Kalpesh's specifications and implemented the following updates:


COORDINATE SYSTEM

I have applied the X-axis flip correction throughout the pipeline. Both the video frames and keypoint coordinates are now transformed to match Unity's coordinate system (Z-forward, Y-up, X-flipped).

Implementation location: src/unity_config.py and tracker_app.py


PRIMARY ANCHOR (Right Hand)

I am using the parameterized grip offsets as Kalpesh suggested. The current values (0.1, 0, 0.03) are configurable through the GripConfig class. This allows us to:
- Adjust for different racket model origins
- Support various grip styles (Continental, Eastern, etc.)
- Fine-tune during Unity integration testing

The racket is now locked to the right wrist as the primary anchor.


SECONDARY ANCHOR (Left Hand)

I agree with Kalpesh's assessment. I am NOT mapping the left hand as a constraint on the racket pose. The noise would create contradictions with the primary anchor. In my implementation:
- Left hand is tracked for visualization purposes only
- Racket dynamics are derived solely from right hand kinematics
- This eliminates jitter from conflicting hand positions


NEXT STEPS

1. I will continue validating the 6-DoF output on the two-handed backhand clips
2. Once Kalpesh confirms the racket model's origin point, I can fine-tune the wrist-to-face-center distance
3. The output is ready for ZeroMQ integration - quaternion orientation + Unity-space position

I should have the Monday deliverable ready - racket seated in the right hand throughout the backhand motion.

Please let me know if you need any adjustments to these parameters.

Best regards,
Prashun
